## Installation
The only additional library required to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python is the `geopandas` library. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

The `geopandas` library can be installed via either `pip` or `conda`.

The libraries used for this project are:
* pandas
* numpy
* geopandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## Project Motivation
For this project, I used the web scraped data from Airbnb's Boston rental market available via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). As part of this, I wanted to answer the following questions:
1. How many units are sitting vacant throughout the year, potentially causing detrimental effects to the housing market in Boston?
2. How has the short-term rental economy grown, in terms of number of hosts?
3. How affordable is airbnb compared to a regular rental unit in various neighborhoods?
4. How many units exist away from the city center?
5. How affordable are units further away from the city center?

## File Descriptions
### Boston Airbnb Datasets
Proper file descriptions for the dataset can be found on [Kaggle's website](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). The data includes data on:
* Listings,
* Availability information, and
* Ratings

### Other Datasets
I also used data from various other sources. These include:
* geojson file from the [Boston Open Data site for the map](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-neighborhoods)
* rental pricing information from [Rent Cafe](https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ma/boston/)

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://github.com/datagy/CRISP-DM/blob/master/Blog%20Post.md).

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
The data was made available via Kaggle, City of Boston, and Rent Cafe.
